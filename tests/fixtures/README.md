The fixture is committed so tests run offline. Embedded extraction is deliberately replaced with a failing dependency in the fallback test; LibRaw still decodes the real, unchanged camera file.

## JPEG fixtures

The photographs in `photos/` were moved from the original visual scaffold. See [their retained credits](photos/CREDITS.md) for photographers, sources, and licenses.

## HDR+ engine fixtures

Three original mobile-camera DNG frames and their attribution are in [hdrplus](hdrplus/README.md). They are licensed CC BY-SA 4.0 and remain separate from supported Sony RAW acceptance.
